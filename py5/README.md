# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a simple **Snake Game** implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The player controls a snake that grows in length every time it eats food. The objective is to keep the snake alive for as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

- The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys.
- The goal is to eat the food (green squares), which makes the snake grow longer.
- Avoid hitting the walls or colliding with yourself, or you'll lose the game.
- After losing, press `C` to play again or `Q` to quit.

## Game Controls

- **Arrow keys**: Move the snake up, down, left, or right.
- **C**: Play again after losing.
- **Q**: Quit the game after losing.
